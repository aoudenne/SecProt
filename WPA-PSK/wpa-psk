(* WPA-PSK 4-way handshake protocol *)

(* Description of the protocol
Goal: Verify that A knows the pre-shared key, aka the pairwise master key (PMK)
Goal: Establish a pairwise transient key (PTK)
Ultimate Goal: Create a PTK between A & B without revealing PMK
A: Supplicant or Wireless Station (STA in paper)
B: Access Point (AP in paper)
MIC: Message Integrity Code
IE: RSN Information Element, carries listof auth and cipher selector fields for communications on RSN-capable stations

1) B->A NonceB
2) A->B NonceA, MIC //B can now compute PTK
3) B->A GTK, MIC   //Group transient key, A can now compute PTK
4) A->B ACK, MIC  //just an aacknowledgement, on wikipedia the MIC isn't mentioned
